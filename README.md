# Gamify The Vote

## Purpose
The goal here is to drive more people to the polls in the USA. Turnout is likely to be a significant factor in the upcoming election and beyond. The goal is to try and motivate otherwise apathetic portions of the electorate through gamification.

## Ideas
1. Register and get first point by "signing up" and pledging to vote
2. Invite friends
3. Get additional points for every friend who signs up
4. Get points for every friend they sign up
5. And so on.

It's a Ponzi scheme for voting.

Additional points potentially for:
* First time registration
* Proof of voting

Leaderboards:
* National
* State

Stats visible:
* Points
* Number of people in your tree
* Ranks
* Party affilliation percentages of people in your tree
* Percentage of new registrations in your tree
* Percentage of actual voters in your tree

Badges:
* # of people in your tree
* # of new registrations in your tree
* # of actual voters in your tree
* 1 in your tree from every state
* 1 in your tree from every party?
